# Automation Platform Github Actions & Workflows

This repository contains github actions and workflows that the Automation Platform team uses in the development workflow automation.

## How to work with this repo

* Develop github actions here to make them reusable
* Develop [reusable workflows here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#creating-a-reusable-workflow)
* Add test workflows here that exemplify the usage of the reusable workflow and can be used for testing the reusable workflow
* Use the issue tracker, project board, ... as data for testing. We do not track development issues in this repositry. Instead, use the [CAMTEAM project in JIRA](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/CAMTEAM)
* Check [commons/README.md] for how to develop the shared codebase of the Javascript github actions
