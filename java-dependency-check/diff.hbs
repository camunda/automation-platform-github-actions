## Limitations 

* The reported transitive dependencies may not always be accurate in a multi-module project.
The SBOM file format represents a unique dependency (coordinates + type) only once. In a multi-module
project a dependency can be declared in multiple locations with different exclusions of transitive dependencies
or different version overrides for transitive dependencies.

## Emojies

* {{emojifyLicense 'Go'}}: All licenses are on the Go list
* {{emojifyLicense 'Caution'}}: (At least one) license is on the Caution list
* {{emojifyLicense 'Stop'}}: (At least one) license is on the Stop list
* {{emojifyLicense 'Unknown'}}: (At least one) license cannot be determined or is unknown
* &#8252;: Dependency has multiple licenses declared
* {{emojifyChangeType 'Upgraded'}}: New dependency version is higher than previous
* {{emojifyChangeType 'Downgraded'}}: New dependency version is lower than previous
* {{emojifyChangeType 'DependenciesChanged'}}: Dependency version is equal and the dependencies of this component changed (e.g. when comparing snapshots)
* {{emojifyChangeType 'Unknown'}}: The change of the dependency version can not be determined further (e.g. because the version does not follow semantic versioning)
